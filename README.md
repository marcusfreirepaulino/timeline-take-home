- What you like about your implementation.

I think I'm really content with the simplicity of the implementation. I was able to do a really quick implementation
without using any UI libraries

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.

I would change the component to be more customizable and to be able to handle better different screen sizes. I will really
try to implement the drag and drop functionality later.

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

The main inspiration basically came from how Jira handles their timeline. Its relatively minimalistic and easy to use.

- How you would test this if you had more time.

I think Cypress would do a good jobs as a testing framework. It would allow me to test all funcionalities end-to-end.
